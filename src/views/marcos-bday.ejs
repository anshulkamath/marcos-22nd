      You'll have to forgive the simplicity of this website; I didn't find it in me to give you the satisfaction of yet another carefully crafted webpage, so I'm limited to sending a single html file.
      Regardless, I hope you enjoyed that little series of puzzles, and you made it to the end! That is, unless you guessed the URL, which is clearly impossible (also, because I have fool-proof security installed). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, you're 22! I loved getting drunk with you. I feel like there's a lot I could say that you already know, so I'll try to find a few things that you might not.
      <ol>
        <li> I really enjoyed having you around in the single next door, even if your door was shut most of the time. Especially after you and Albany started dating, I would suddenly feel weird with having the door closed with Claire, but there you were doing the same thing one door down. </li> 
        <li> I was honestly considering repurposing the entire list, but I don't really want to do that.</li>
        <li> I sincerely enjoyed our senior trip together, and I really valued your "help-get-things-done" attitude. It made planning things a lot more managable. </li>
        <li> You probably already know this, but I'm high key jealous that you'll be in NY and I won't be (although I know the feeling is mutual for me being in Seattle). I hope you're able to make the most of the city, but don't become more of a New Yorker than I am. </li>
        <li> I hope that this gift hasn't been too wholesome yet (I know you're deathly allergic), especially considering we haven't gotten to the kicker yet... </li>
        <li> This last part is <strong>very important.</strong> To procure your gift, please text "I'm home you dirty slut" to (978)-908-9138 </li>
        <li> Finally, I want to apologize for getting carried away with this present. I am constantly playing from behind when it comes to our birthdays (considering I only have 10 days to respond in kind), so I thought I would go balls-to-the-wall for our seemingly last hurrah. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, a very happy birthday to you; hope this year brings out the best in you. ðŸŒµ
