          Hello you music connesieur. It seems that you've somehow made your way to this challenge.
          Luckily for you, I've been pleased with your progress thus far.
          To show my appreciation and respect for your tenacity, I've decided to give you a `fun` challenge.
          Welcome to my newest creation, Memory Lane.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game is meant to test your nostalgic connection to your Spotify playlist.
          The game proceeds as follows: when you begin, a song will start playing.
          Your job is to try and guess both the name of the song as well as the date it was added to your playlist.
          Both the name and the date contribute 5 points to your total score.
          Also, I've tried to be ~accomodating~ by using a dynamic Levenshtein-distance threshold for naming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, you have the opportunity to get bonus points.
          There will be up to three durations of the song: 1 second, 5 seconds, and 15 seconds.
          If you are able to guess the song in 1 second, an additional 5 points will be added to your score.
          If you are able to guess the song in 5 seconds, then an additional point will be added to your score.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be asking `So when do I win?`
          Well, my young duckling, that's the beauty of the game... it's up to me to decide!
          Luckily time flies when you're having fun, because this is gonna take a while.
          So hunker down and start playing!
        </p>
        <p>
          P.S. If you're not Marcos, then feel free to enter a (public) Spotify playlist ID in the form below to customize the game to
